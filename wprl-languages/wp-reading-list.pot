"\t\t\t<b>Available Layouts</b>: There are two layouts available, \"grid\" "

"\t\t\t<b>Order Posts By</b>: There are four options available for ordering "

"\".  \"Date\" is the default, and WordPress&apos;s default, which orders "
"posts by the date they were published.  \"Post Author\" orders Reading List "
"items by alphabetizing the author of the post.  (*Note here, this is not the "
"author or authors that you listed when you wrote your Reading List item.)  "
"This is useful if you have multiple contributors who are all writing Reading "
"List items and you want to sort by who is contributing what.  \"Random\" is "
"pretty straightforward; your Reading List items are put in random order "
"every time the page is loaded.  \"Title\" allows you to display Reading List "
"items alphabetically by their title.\n"

"\t\t\t<b>Order Direction</b>: Descending order is the WordPress default and "

"\t\t\t<b>Available Layouts</b>: There are two layouts available, \"grid\" "
"and \"list\". \"Grid\" is a layout which emphasizes cover images is intended "
"to be more visually appealing.  \"List\" is a layout which displays Reading "
"List materials more like traditional posts, with one item per line.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<b>Order Posts By</b>: There are four options available for ordering "
"your Reading List items, \"Date\", \"Post Author\", \"Random\", and \"Title"
"\".  \"Date\" is the default, and WordPress&apos;s default, which orders "
"posts by the date they were published.  \"Post Author\" orders Reading List "
"items by alphabetizing the author of the post.  (*Note here, this is not the "
"author or authors that you listed when you wrote your Reading List item.)  "
"This is useful if you have multiple contributors who are all writing Reading "
"List items and you want to sort by who is contributing what.  \"Random\" is "
"pretty straightforward; your Reading List items are put in random order "
"every time the page is loaded.  \"Title\" allows you to display Reading List "
"items alphabetically by their title.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<b>Order Direction</b>: Descending order is the WordPress default and "
"it orders Reading List items from newest to oldest in the case dates and "
"from the end of the alphabet to numbers for text.  Ascending order is the "
"opposite.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<b>Left Margin</b>: This option allows you to specify how far over to "
"the right (from the left-hand side of the screen) that you want your "
"content.  Use this to match your theme&apos;s layout or customize your "
"views.  <br/>Range: 0-25.\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n"
"\n"
